          England Men’s cricket team has announced a 17-member squad for the
          upcoming three-match Test series against Pakistan in October, marking
          a crucial tour on spinning subcontinental pitches.
        </p>

        <p class="sp-content-para">
          The squad sees the return of spinners Rehan Ahmed and Jack Leach, both
          expected to play pivotal roles in Pakistan’s spin-friendly conditions.

        <h1 class="sp-content-heading">Benstokes Missed Squad</h1>

        <p class="sp-content-para">
          Eight players from England’s historic 3-0 series win in Pakistan in
          2022, including Rehan Ahmed, Harry Brook, Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett,
          Jack Leach, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, and captain Ben Stokes, have been
          retained. Their familiarity with the conditions could provide a
          significant advantage.

        <p class="sp-content-para">
          Jack Leach, who has been sidelined since January 2024, returns to the
          Test squad, while Rehan Ahmed seeks to add to his four Test caps after
          debuting in Pakistan.
